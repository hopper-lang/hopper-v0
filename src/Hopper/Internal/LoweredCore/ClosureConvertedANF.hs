DESIGN
- this is the closure-converted let normal form (ANF) sibling of the types-as-calling-conventions language/abstract machine
- all variables are local vars
- all thunks and closures are replaced with symbolic IDs to the underlying code that will run when provided with the
  appropriate environment structure, and, if appropriate, the applicable function args
- consequences:
    - all code becomes first-order
    - all heap refs flow through a local env stack
    - (for now) all values held on the heap have a double indirection via env to heap
-}

{-
DESIGN NOTE:
once RTS is more mature, references to statically resolved / restricted values / functions
should be supported along with jumping through the local environment scope

may also want to think about some values only being listed in the local environment vs also being in the heap,
maybe
