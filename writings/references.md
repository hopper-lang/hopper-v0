## [I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'](https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/conor.mcbride/pub/Rig.pdf)

The first work to combine linear and dependent types in a satisfying way. This paper is the basis of Hopper's resource tracking and, especially, typechecking.

## [Types are calling conventions](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/strict-core/tacc-hs09.pdf)

This paper defines a compiler intermediate langauge, Strict Core ANF, which is the inspiration for Hopper's intermediate language CC (closure-converted) ANF (administrative normal form). Evaluation of CC ANF bears a striking resemblance to *Figure 7: Operational semantics of Strict Core ANF* from the paper.
